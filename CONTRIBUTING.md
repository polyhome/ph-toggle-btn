# Introduction

## Thank you!

If you are looking at this with the intention of contributing, thank you! Maintaining an open source project is a great adventure, only made better by other people joining in.

## Guidelines

These guidelines have been put in place for two reasons. First and foremost it's to ensure everyone follows the same philosophy, and reduces discussions on how plans should be carried. As a consequence of this, and the second reason, contributing should be a more streamlined and enjoyable process.

## What contributions are we looking for

Almost all kinds of contributions are acceptable here! Whether it be adding new code or optimizing new code, or perhaps smaller stuff like spelling errors. Even if you don't know how to fix something yourself, feel free to open an issue, and we will do our best to help you through it.

# Ground Rules

## Expectations for contributions

### Behavioral

First and foremost there are some behavioral expectations, when it comes it interacting with the community. Sometimes contributions don't live up to the standards of the project. This is absolutely fine, and should be acknowledged.

Both as the one given the critique and the one recieving, remember to communicate in a respectable fashion, and do not resort to negative conversation. Take it as a learning opportunity. Read more about this in the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Technical

Responsibilites

- Ensure that code quality is up to par. Unless it makes sense not to, remember to document any new functions and classes
- Create issues for any major change or enhancement. Not only will this make it clear to others that it's being worked on, it lends itself to community feedback.
- Keep contributions as small as possible. Rather than making one pull request for 10 features, make individual pull requests.

# Your First Contribution

IF you've never contributed to an open source project before, start by looking at the issues section. Here you can look for the issues labeled with 'good-first-issue'. These are marked specifically to help newcomers get into the game. In case you're not sure on how to make a contribution, here are some great resources: http://makeapullrequest.com and http://www.firsttimersonly.com

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# Getting started

## The process of a contribution

While you may submit a contribution in whichever way you like, it helps if everyone follows the same process.

### Creating an issue

As mentioned earlier, issues help keep track of what is going on. If you are wanting to contribute something new, you should in most cases create an issue first. That way you can create a point of conversation, and it's possible to asses how valuable this will be.

If you want to work on an already exisiting issue, engage in conversation on that particular issue. Inform people that you wil start working on that issue. Or in the case that you are just interested in working on it, express interest in that and provide the information you need to get started.

### Creating a Pull Request

You're almost done! When you feel that you've done everything correctly, go make your pull request. If you don't know how to do this, look at the resources linked above. Don't worry if it isn't perfect at this point, that's what the community is there to help with.

> NOTE: Please refer to the exisiting issue when submitting your PR

### Adding to CHANGELOG.md

This is a minor step, but important nonetheless. In order to keep track of what has been done, this repo uses a CHANGELOG.md. At the top you will a heading named `Unreleased`. Under here you should add whatever changes you have made under one of the following subheadings:

- Added
- Changed
- Deprecated
- Removed
- Fixed
- Security

The maintainers will then use this when pushing a new version into production.

### Finishing Touches

If you've done everything correctly and the features work, you shouldn't have to do much more at this point. The contribution will be pulled into the codebase, and you can be proud of your work!

If for some reason some changes need to be made, the official maintainers will leave a comment with advice on where to go from there.

# How to report a bug

## Security Flaws

If you do find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue about it. Send a mail to contact@polyhome.io instead. While we would very much like to provide bug bounties for this sort of thing, the funds simply aren't there to do it. However any information regarding improvements in security will always be appreciated!

## Bugs

If you happen to find a regular bug, please open an issue here on GitHub. When creating an issue you should see different templates, where you can choose to make a bug report.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

The process is almost the same as a bug report. When opening an issue, you should also find a template for feature requests.

Keep in mind that you may not be the only one with a particular request. Please search the existing issues, to see whether or not it has already been brought up. Some things may not be implemented because of variations reasons.

# Code review process

Once the code has been reviewed and deemed fit, it will be accepted into the code base.

# Community

Most general discussion about the code base will be discussed through issues here on GitHub. However we also have a community over at [/r/polyhome](https://reddit.com/r/polyhome).
